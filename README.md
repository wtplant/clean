This is my personal website, with links to all of my projects. The website, and the projext were  built with Python using the Django Web Framework. It was deployed via AWS Lightsail and an Apache Web Server.

**TO START, THE PROJECT RESIDES IN THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORY ON THE SERVER:**

`cd apps/django/django_projects/clean/`

To pull from this repo on the lightsail instance, be sure to be logged on as super user. 

**To update the about page edit the following html file:**

clean/templates/home.html
